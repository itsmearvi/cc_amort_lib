# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Amortization Library

This Python library provides a comprehensive solution to **plan and analyze credit card payments**, including amortization schedules, minimum payments, interest calculations, and visualization. It supports **multiple cards**, allows **maximum monthly allocation**, and provides **interactive and downloadable outputs**.

---

## Features

- Load multiple credit cards from a `cards.csv` file containing:
  - `name` â€“ Card name
  - `balance` â€“ Current outstanding balance
  - `apr_percent` â€“ Annual Percentage Rate
  - `min_override` (optional) â€“ Fixed minimum payment
  - `min_pct` (optional) â€“ Minimum payment as percentage of balance

- Automatically compute:
  - Monthly interest based on APR
  - Minimum due (customizable per card)
  - Payment allocation across multiple cards (highest APR gets majority of max allowed)
  - Remaining balances month-by-month
  - Total interest paid
  - Tenure to pay off each card

- **CLI, Streamlit, and Gradio GUI versions**:
  - **CLI**: run from command line with CSV input and export options
  - **Streamlit**: interactive web interface with per-card CSV, Excel workbook, and chart
  - **Gradio**: interactive GUI in browser with downloads and visualization

- Outputs include:
  - Per-card amortization schedules (CSV)
  - Monthly allocation summary (CSV)
  - Excel workbook with all schedules
  - Summary table including opening balance, total interest, tenure, start and end payment
  - Interactive balance chart (Streamlit/Gradio)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd <repo_directory>
````

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install pandas streamlit gradio plotly openpyxl
```

> The `requirements.txt` should include:

```
pandas
streamlit
gradio
plotly
openpyxl
```

## CSV Format Example

```csv
name,balance,apr_percent,min_override,min_pct
Visa,1000,18.24,50,2
MasterCard,5000,15,,1.5
Amex,2000,20,,
```

* `min_override` is optional; if not provided, `min_pct` is used.
* `min_pct` is optional; if not provided, default 2% of balance is used.
* At least `name`, `balance`, and `apr_percent` are required.

---

## Usage

### 1. CLI

```bash
python amort_cli.py --cards path/to/cards.csv --max 500 --outdir output_folder
```

* `--cards` â€“ path to `cards.csv`
* `--max` â€“ maximum allowed monthly payment
* `--outdir` â€“ directory for output CSV/Excel files

Outputs:

* Per-card CSV files (`<card_name>_schedule.csv`)
* Monthly allocation CSV (`monthly_allocation.csv`)
* Excel workbook (`schedules.xlsx`)
* Summary CSV (`summary.csv`)

---

### 2. Streamlit GUI

```bash
streamlit run amort_streamlit.py
```

* Upload `cards.csv` in the browser
* Set **Max Allowed Monthly Payment**
* Click **Compute Schedules**
* Download per-card CSVs, Excel workbook, monthly summary, and summary CSV
* View interactive balance chart

> Computation occurs only when the file or max allowed payment changes or when the **Compute Schedules** button is clicked.

---

### 3. Gradio GUI

```bash
python amort_gradio.py
```

* Upload `cards.csv`
* Set **Max Allowed Monthly Payment**
* Click **Compute**
* Download outputs (per-card CSVs, Excel workbook, monthly summary, summary CSV)
* View interactive Plotly balance chart

> Computation is triggered **only on Compute button click**.

---

## Developer Notes

* The core logic is implemented in `amort_allocator.py` using the `SimpleCard` dataclass.
* `plan_multi_card_with_max()` handles payment allocation:

  * Highest APR card gets the **majority of max allowed payment**
  * Other cards receive their **min due + interest**
* `generate_summary()` produces per-card summaries with:

  * Opening balance
  * Total interest
  * Tenure
  * Start/end payment
